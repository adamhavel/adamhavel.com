I'm thirty-something, living just outside of Prague, in a small house with a big garden. I have a knack for designing systems, visual or technical, and a love of simple, beautiful solutions. And, just to bring a tiny bit of chaos into this otherwise orderly life of mine, I do swing dancing, and listen to — and play! — weird music, usually at the same time.

I've jumped into the digital river early, my age still in the comfortable range of single digits. I looked into the river, then, through a magnificent little device, the *Macintosh Classic*, and my career oficially started when I attempted to create several Star Wars themed text adventures — those were a craze back then — in [HyperTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk). I quickly gave up, though. Maybe because of lack of persistence, or because I had no idea what a `loop` is — but probably both.

Few years after that, when I realized I won't be designing games any time soon, I've built my first website. The purpose? As expected, to celebrate the best game of them all, *Baldur's Gate*. Full of glorious animated GIFs and good old `font` elements, creating the website felt like fun, but most importantly, it was **there**, on the internet, made by me, for everyone to see. It wasn't long before I built [another](https://web.archive.org/web/20040902061956/http://cowboybebop.wz.cz/film.html), this time about the greatest anime of all time, *Cowboy Bebop*.

I quickly realized I could do this for other people — and for money, too! Since then, I might have made close to a hundred websites, each one a little better than the previous.

After studying this thing called information technology at [CTU](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en) in Prague, I landed my first real job at [Czech Radio](https://www.rozhlas.cz). That was back in the era of the *LAMP* stack, a time where the divide between the front and the back haven't yet reached the depth and distance it spans today. But step by step, I chose the **front-end** side. That helped me get a job at [Heureka](https://m.heureka.cz) where, for the past four years, I've been helping tranforming the whole monolith into a responsive bundle.

Most recently, I've started [teaching](/workshops/) full-day **workshops** on JavaScript — what makes it a different, great (and at times, terrible) tool for modern web development.
