Examiner is a web application for both teachers and students. Its purpose is to help the first group with the dull process of creating and evaluating written tests. The students, then, use the same application for taking the tests. At the end, both groups part ways. Hopefully in peace.

The design was heavily inspired by notebooks from the company [Baron Fig](https://www.baronfig.com/) that I used when studying at college. I was especially drawn to the bold colors and accents Baron Fig chose for their notebooks, like the distinct yellow cloth bookmark. I wanted the application to feel as physical as possible, without resorting to overt skeuomorphism, keeping the look clean and simple. So, taking cues from the notebooks, I've decided to make it resemble a piece of paper, with colorful ribbons for a menu.

It begins when a teacher decides to create a new test. At first, he is presented with an empty sheet of paper. Using the provided controls, he quickly fills the paper with various sections and questions. A question consists of various types of content mixed together, for example simple text, code example, image, or diagram, drawn direcly in the application. An answer can be a similar mix, or it can take a form of multiple choice. When finished, the test is saved and assigned a subject. All that remains, then, is giving it a date and time, and it's ready for taking.
