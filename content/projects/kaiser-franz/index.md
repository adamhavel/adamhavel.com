Kaiser Franz is an original concept of various forms of gastronomy based on street food and its stalls with burgers can be found at farmers markets in Prague and at events throughout the country. Along with the opening of the Prague bistro, there was a desire to change the logo and launch the website.

The name Kaiser Franz, of course, comes from the penultimate Emperor of Austria-Hungary, Franz Joseph I. It was from his unmistakable mustache that grew the basis for a new logo and first inspiration. The second part of the puzzle was created in connection with another well-known king of Czech lands, Rudolf II. Habsburg. This emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was portrayed in a peculiar way by the Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo, who composed his portraits in the manner of still life from various subjects, mostly food. And although we are one or four centuries apart from the two regents, their forms have remained generally known today.

To avoid the nostalgia, however, the logo uses [Mrs Eaves XL Modern](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mr-Eaves-Sans-and-Modern). His job is to balance the logo - full of details and associations - and bring it back to the present. The font is therefore simple, straightforward, and modern, with the exception of a small decoration in the letter "R", which again evokes the Emperor's book. This detail comes in handy when the name Kaiser Franz is displayed separately. When the logo needs to be displayed in small dimensions, only a simplified silhouette can be used instead of the detailed version.

The focus of Kaiser Franz is food of all kinds. It is also emphasized on the website at [kaiserfranz.cz](https://kaiserfranz.cz) and photos of burgers and bistro therefore constitute the most distinctive element of the resulting design. The rest of the website is as simple as possible visually and in content and offers only the most important information about future events or current offer in the bistro. Therefore, the site does not contain any complex controls and naturally adapts to different devices and screen sizes.

The site is built on the [Hugo generator](https://gohugo.io/), which means that it doesn't need a database or application server. The output of the generator is simple HTML documents, which are in principle fast and unpretentious, and thanks to the [Netlify platform](https://www.netlify.com/), immediately available anywhere in the world. The content is managed by a simple [CMS system](https://www.netlifycms.org/) (also from Netlify), which operates directly over [GitHub source files](https://github.com/adamhavel/kaiserfranz.cz). If they change, they will automatically create a new version of the site.
